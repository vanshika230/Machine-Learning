# 🔥 Procedure

1️⃣ Pick a website and describe your objective

- Browse through different sites and pick one to scrape. 

- Identify the information you'd like to scrape from the site. Decide the format of the output CSV file.

- Summarize your project idea and outline your strategy in a Juptyer notebook.

2️⃣ Use the requests library to download web pages

- Inspect the website's HTML source and identify the right URLs to download.

- Download and save web pages locally using the requests library.

- Create a function to automate downloading for different topics/search queries.

3️⃣ Use Beautiful Soup to parse and extract information

- Parse and explore the structure of downloaded web pages using Beautiful soup.

- Use the right properties and methods to extract the required information.

- Create functions to extract from the page into lists and dictionaries.

- (Optional) Use a REST API to acquire additional information if required.

4️⃣ Create CSV file(s) with the extracted information

- Create functions for the end-to-end process of downloading, parsing, and saving CSVs.

- Execute the function with different inputs to create a dataset of CSV files.

- Verify the information in the CSV files by reading them back using Pandas.
